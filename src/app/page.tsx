            Construction started in 1936. The first plane landed on 25 October
            1939, signalling the beginning of air traffic. At this time, it was
            one of the most modern airports in the world. It replaced the
            airfield at Oberwiesenfeld (now the site of the Olympic Village). In
            World War II it was home to Adolf Gulland’s legendary. It was almost
            completely destroyed by bombings on 9 April 1945. Until that day,
            civilian air traffic had also been handled in Riem. George Raffled
            of the United States Rainbow Division was the first of the allied
            forces to arrive at the airport. He reported to his superior
            officers that the airport had been abandoned by the Germans. <br />
            After the war Munich-Riem was the first airport in Germany to be
            used for civil aviation. Post-war operations started on 6 April 1948
            with the landing of a DC-3 operated by Pan American World Airways.
            On 12 October 1949 the Flughafen München-Riem GmbH (Munich-Riem
            Airport Ltd.) was founded. Wulf-Dieter Graf zoo Castell became one
            of its managing directors. The airports runway was lengthened to
            1,900 meters (6,234 ft) in November 1949. <br />
            Since the 1980s and into the early 1990s, the airfield was heavily
            congested. Originally the terminal was intended to handle between
            five and eight million passengers per year, but by 1991 the
            passenger numbers had skyrocketed to twelve million passengers per
            year, which was 50% to more than double the number of passengers
            that the airport was originally designed to handle.
